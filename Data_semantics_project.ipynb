Fistral's got some epic conditions today with those 6-foot waves and offshore winds - that means we can expect a good session if the tide is right. Bells, on the flip side, is as calm as a sleeping kitty cat, so no big swell to ride there. Watergate Bay's got some choppy conditions with those 3ft waves and onshore winds - it might be a bit of a struggle out there but that's what makes surfing an adventure!
